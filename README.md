Capacitor plugin for accessing environment variables in native code.

This plugin provides a secure way to access environment variables that were
compiled into the native application at build time. Environment variables
can be configured during the build process and accessed at runtime without
exposing them in the web bundle.

### getKey(...)

```typescript
getKey(options: { key: string; }) => Promise<{ value: string; }>
```

Retrieves the value of a specific environment variable by key.

This method fetches environment variables that were set during the native
build process. The variables must be configured in the native project
before they can be accessed at runtime.

| Param         | Type                          | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`options`** | <code>{ key: string; }</code> | - Configuration object containing the environment variable key |

**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;{ value: string; }&gt;</code>

--------------------


### getPluginVersion()

```typescript
getPluginVersion() => Promise<{ version: string; }>
```

Get the version of the native Capacitor plugin.

This method returns the current version of the capacitor-env plugin
that is installed in the native application. Useful for debugging
and ensuring compatibility between the web and native components.

**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;{ version: string; }&gt;</code>
